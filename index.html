<h1> The Question: </h1>
<p> If you had a time machine, in which period of history would you like to live? <br>
Are there current technologies that you would like to take with you? Could your choice of technologies be taken with you without taking others? <br>
To what extent can one technology be separated from another? <br>
Is it consistent to protest against global warming yet accept modern medical treatment? </p> 
<h3> Let's Break It Down: </h3>

<p> My favorite historical period is Ancient Rome, specifically the turn of the millennium (between 25 BCE - 25 CE); post civil war and the beginning of the empire. This is a period of incredible importance for European and Mediterranean history. The most influential society in the region goes through its greatest period of change. An introduction of a new technology during this time would so radically change the world it would be unrecognizable. 
<br> <br>
Which brings me to the second question. What technology would I bring with me? This is a question of thought about before, and it comes down to two things. A technology simple enough that it could be fairly easily implemented, and technology that doesn’t require existing infrastructure or a series of technological innovations alongside it. It also has to be something I could easily learn about, but for the sake of argument let's say I could communicate the technology. We will also disregard a language barrier and also the chance of rapid death due to diseases my immune system is not equipped to handle. Time Travel hypotheticals are rarely about logistics, but are thought experiments and this is no different. 
<br> <br> 
The technology I would bring is the steam engine. It might surprise you to learn that the Romans were actually fully capable of creating a steam engine. The ancient alexandrian mathematician The Hero of Alexandria, more commonly known as Heron, is most well known for the creation of a device called the Aeolipile which is credited as being the first steam engine. It is first referenced by Virtruvius, author of De Architectura (and also the namesake of the Vitruvian man). Heron also describes and has schematics for his steam engine in The Pneumatics of Hero of Alexandria.

<p>
Now obviously the Romans did not invent the steam engine. Likely due to the lack of necessity to innovate or perhaps a culture that wasn’t interested in the funding of strange science projects. However with the right push I believe the Romans absolutely could make the leap. They already had access to the skills and resources necessary to create the engine. They would just need the application, and drive to implement it. 
<br> <br>
Now while for the purposes of deciding which technology to bring I assumed an implied level of expertise at implementation if we are to take the question entirely literally I would need at least three other people:  A person skilled in the metalworking and the schematics of steam engines, A latin scholar to translate, and a doctor or someone with the medical training to understand how to treat the diseases we could encounter. Realistically we’d likely need several of each, both as redundancy and to offer second opinions and to cover a wider range of possible scenarios. 
<br> <br>
As for the next question, in the case of steam engines there are not as many technologies working together as say jet engines. There would still need to be some prior knowledge. For example I could not take the idea of the steam engine back to a society without metallurgy or fire. The extent to which technology can be isolated is related to its complexity in components and concepts. The more components the harder they are to obtain and the more technologies are needed. Human achievements do not exist in a vacuum and are only possible because of past achievements. 
<br> <br>
Which leads into the final question. If all technology is connected in some way shape or form by a complicated web of discoveries and innovations how can you reject one technology while accepting another made possible by the former. I believe it is important to recognize that not all innovations are wholly positive or wholly negative. Innovation comes with ramifications, and it is up to us as a society to mitigate the risks while retaining technological growth, and also that technologies once discovered are not always dependent on each other. While knowledge is important the implementation isn’t. The industrial revolution coexisted with the rapid medical revolution. But now that we have the knowledge of these medical innovations an industrial revolution like environment is no longer needed. So the protesting of global warming and acceptance of modern medicine is perfectly reasonable. They coexist but are not codependent. You can have one without the other and vice versa. 
<br><br>
In summary, I would like to live in Ancient Rome during the transition from republic to empire. <br>
I would bring the steam engine with me as the Romans had the capability for creating one. <br>
My choice of technology and time period would require me bringing at minimum three other people. <br>
Technological seperation depends on the complexity of that technology. <br>
Yes it is consistent to protest global warming while also recognizing that the same technologies allowed for the advancements in modern medicine. <br>
This brings us to the end of our discussion. Hopefully I have answered the questions to your satisfaction.
